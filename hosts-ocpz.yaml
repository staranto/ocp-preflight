# This inventory will need to be edited after it is generated.  This 
# is also a great opportunity to think through the environment and 
# be sure things appears correct.
# Entries must sync up with the DNS zone for 0.taranto.dev.
# By extra attentive and doublecheck everything.  Time well spent!

    # number should be 3!! Don't change it.  I would also highly
    # recommend that you leave the 'master-n' prefix along.  If you have
    # tooling that works with the simple hostname, you could change it
    # to be 'ocpz-master-0'.  But keep the zero-based
    # index in there.
